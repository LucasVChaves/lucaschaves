# lucaschaves

My personal site.  
It uses a basic HTML structure and CSS styling to display information about me and my projects.  
The site is hosted on GitHub Pages and can be accessed [here](https://lucaschaves.github.io/).  
The design is based on [this project](http://owickstrom.github.io/the-monospace-web/) by [Oskar Wickstr√∂m](http://wickstrom.tech/).
